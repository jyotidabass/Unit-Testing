# Unit-Testing

Unit testing is a way to test individual parts, or "units," of your code to ensure they work as expected. It helps you find and fix bugs early in the development process and gives you confidence that your code is reliable.

Imagine your code as a large building made up of many small bricks (functions, methods, and classes). Unit testing is like testing each brick individually to ensure they are built correctly and perform their intended functions. This way, you can be sure that the building (your program) will be sturdy and function as expected when all the bricks are put together.
